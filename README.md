# exhibition : biometric exit

BIOMETRIC EXIT explores the normalisation of monitoring and surveillance in all domains of public and private life. Since the 90s CCTV cameras have been added in urban areas for the state purposes of “security”, but in fact are often used to create networks of hyper-surveillance and consumer formation.

The installation BIOMETRIC EXIT is comprised of a hacked, unreliable Computer Vision (CV) algorithm that creates real-time facial recognition, tracking attendees in the gallery, reading expressions and falsely noting predictive behaviours. As a form of learning, how to disrupt, reject, and confuse the algorithm BIOMETRIC EXIT functions as a mitigated version of the CV apparatus. MIDPUNKT will provide facial camouflage, laser pens and face paints for those attempting to view the exhibition incognito.
